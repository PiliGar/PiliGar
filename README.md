# I'm Pilar!

![Hi I'm UI Designer and Front End Developer](https://github.com/PiliGar/PiliGar/raw/master/video2.gif)

I'm a UI Designer and Front End Developer based in Madrid.

I studied Fine Arts and discovered how to apply my visual skills to our reality through technology. I love to resolve people's problems with useful and beautiful products that connect users, services, and business. This adventure brings me fun, challenges, some cups of coffee, and exceptional people to learn from.

After +5 years of experience combining my skills of usability, user interface design, and Front End development I decided to further my background with new technologies based in Javascript. I took this challenge and joined the Ironhack's Web Development Bootcamp in Madrid which I've recently finished.

## Now my goal is to keep **specializing in Front End Development** with Javascript (React.js) and face new projects where I can add value and keep learning.
